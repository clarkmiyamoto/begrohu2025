\section{Overview}
In these lectures, we are interested in creating phase diagrams, where the macrostate is wether the neural network learns the data distribution, as we vary relevant quantities of the network (i.e. size dependence, architecture, etc.)\\
\\
We'll go over
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Intro to Hebbian Networks
	\item Hopfield Model
	\item Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Hebbian Networks
	\item 
\end{enumerate}
